Possible tasks that can be done by artificial intelligence to perform this goal include: 
1. Natural Language Processing (NLP) for understanding user input and responding appropriately.
2. Machine Learning algorithms such as regression, decision trees, or neural networks for making predictions in response to questions asked by users. 
3. Automating mundane tasks like data entry into a database or sorting through large amounts of information quickly and accurately using automated search tools built with AI technology .  
4. Image Recognition software used to identify objects within an image based on pre-defined criteria from the system’s training set of images/objects it has been taught about beforehand .  
5 Automatic Speech Recognition systems which convert spoken language into text so that computers can respond accordingly when given verbal commands .  6 Using Robotics Process Automation (RPA) bots programmed with specific instructions to complete repetitive processes faster than humans could do manually 7 Generative Artificial Intelligence models trained on massive datasets allowing them create new content either completely autonomously or semi-autonomously after being provided some initial parameters 8 Autonomous vehicle navigation systems designed intelligently enough not only drive safely but also make decisions independently while driving
